# Technologies Used: 

To build this site I used Java Script, CSS, HTML, Django, Python and PSQL 

I used JavaScript to handle the DOM manipulation and CSS to style the page. 

Django was used to handle user AUTH, profile image uploads, embeded video and routes. 

PSQL was used to handle the Database side of things. 


# Getting Started:

There is a set of starter workouts on the home page. You can use those to start your workout list.
Once you create an account you can start creating workouts. Find a youtube workout video you like and create your workout. 
Then you can track your exercise data. 


# Next Steps:

I would like to add a metric tracking system. That way the user could see their progress.
