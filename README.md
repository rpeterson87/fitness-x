## Description

I have been working out for more than 10 years now. I started by using an old men's fitness book and notepad to track my workout data. I then found this guy on youtube by the name of Jeff Cavaliere.
I started watching his youtube videos and later bought his first program. I loved it and I have continued to used his programs to this day. However I also wanted to use some of his web content. He puts out stuff almost daily and a lot of it is really good stuff, but I would once again be back to the old note pad to track my data. So I set out to build a website that could do all of the above. 
At Fitness-X you can store not only your favorite youtube workout videos, you can also store all of your workout data. For now it is pretty straight forward but I would like to build in more features. But more on that later.

# Technologies Used: 

To build this site I used Java Script, CSS, HTML, Django, Python and PSQL. 

I used JavaScript to handle the DOM manipulation and CSS to style the page. I also used a combination of bootsrap and Bulma for styling the layout and forms. 

Django was used to handle user AUTH, profile image uploads, embedded video, Routes and Models. This allowed me to build a much more robust user experience with personal accounts and profiles.  

PSQL was used to handle the Database side of things. 


# Getting Started:

There is a set of starter workouts on the home page. You can use those to start your workout list.
Once you create an account you can start saving workouts. Find a youtube workout video you like and create your workout playlist. 
Then you can track your exercise data on the videos show page. 


# Next Steps:

I would like to add a metric tracking system so that you could see your progression. Also I like to add in individual Workout pages for each profile so that it would cut down on the noise and let you focus on just your stuff. I would like to add in more community functions so others could share their progress and success stories along with the youtube API allowing you to just search on the site for the workouts you want.
